<!-- <h2>Code Assignments</h2> -->
<div id="book-page">
  <p>
    The mandatory code assignments will include starter code that you will work
    with to complete the assignment. This means that the repository will include
    code that you will update, based on the instructions provided.
  </p>
  <p>
    For each assignment, take time to read all instructions and requirements
    provided for the assignment. If there are instructions that you do not
    understand, contact an instructor or teaching assistant for clarification.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once you understand what is expected, take time to plan out the code, using
    flowcharts, pseudocode, class diagrams, or ERDs as appropriate for the
    activity. This will help you define what you want the code to do and make
    the time you spend writing code more efficient. You may be asked to provide
    this documentation for some assignments.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you start to code, write the code incrementally and run it after each
    step. Running the code frequently will make it easier to identify and
    pinpoint errors as you work and correct those errors before starting the
    next increment of code.
  </p>
  <aside>
    <h4>⚠ Important!</h4>
    <p>
      Each GitHub Classroom code assignment will contain at least one file. Do
      not change or delete any existing files unless instructed to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where you are expected to change an existing file, the assignment
      instructions will clearly state which file or files you are expected to
      update.
    </p>

  <p>
    Click the link provided by the instructor or in the assignment instruction
    and authorize GitHub Classroom to access your account, if prompted to do so.
  </p>
  <p>GitHub Classroom will then prompt you to accept the assignment.</p>

  <p>
    Clone the repository to a local folder. Instructions for cloning a
    repository are provided elsewhere in this course.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once the repository has been cloned to your computer, open the project
    folder in your preferred IDE (such as NetBeans or IntelliJ). Take time to
    examine the existing files, but do not change any file except as specified
    in the assignment instructions.
  </p>
  <p>
    You are encouraged to commit frequently as you work on the assignment. Each
    time you commit, use a commit message like <em>commit1</em>,
    <em>commit2</em>, <em>commit3</em>, etc., incrementing as you go. The number
    of commits is not important, and there is no maximum number of allowed
    commits.
  </p>
  <h3>Checking Your Work</h3>
  <p>
    The code assignments that start with a template repository include unit
    tests that will check your code each time you commit the code. The exact
    number of tests depends on the complexity of the program, but they will
    usually range between 3-5 tests.
  </p>
  <aside>
    <p style="text-align: center">
      ⚠ Your code must pass all tests by the specified due date and time for you
      to receive credit for your work.
    </p>
  </aside>
  <p>You can run the tests in two different ways:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Use your IDE (NetBeans or IntelliJ) to run the unit tests in the IDE.
    </li>
    <li>Push updates to the code to GitHub.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Failing tests will not count against you during the development process. You
    are encouraged to run tests frequently to check your progress, and it is
    expected that tests will fail until you complete all parts of the
    assignment.
  </p>

  <p>
    This lesson shows a few options for running these tests and viewing the
    results.
    <strong>These are not the only ways to complete this task!</strong> If you
    are already familiar with another way to run and check unit tests, you are
    welcome to use that process instead of using the steps shown here.
  </p>
  <p>Select your IDE to see details on how to run the unit tests.</p>

          Build the project as soon as it opens. This will add in all of the
          dependencies identified by Maven and run all tests included in the
          project. The tests will fail at this point, but it gives you a
          starting point to work from.

          In this example, there is a main test file

          <code>testSalaryCalculator1</code>.

        <p>
          We can tell that the tests failed by the statement: "Tests run: 2,
          Failures: 2."

          In this example, the assignment asks us to add code to the if-else
          block. We'll start with the if clause.
        </p>
        <p>Review the existing variables already declared in the class:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre
            class="prettyprint lang-java"
          ><code>final static int StandardWorkingHours = 40;
static String EmployeeID;
static String EmployeeName;
static int HoursWorked;
static int HourlyRate;
static int BasicPay;
static int OverTime;
static int OverTimeRate;
static int OverTimePay;
static int GrossSalary;</code></pre>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Because these variables already exist, we can use them in the methods
          without having to redeclare them.
        </p>
        <p>
          We want to calculate the total salary by multiplying the number of
          hours worked (HW) by the hourly rate (HR). We can write an equation
          for that. Note that the existing method
          (<code>SalaryCalculator</code>) returns the variable
          <code>GrossSalary</code>, so we want to be sure that the result is
          saved to <code>GrossSalary</code>.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <pre
            class="prettyprint lang-java"
          ><code>if(HW &lt;= StandardWorkingHours)
{
  //YOUR CODE STARTS HERE
  <mark>GrossSalary = HoursWorked * HourlyRate;</mark>

  //YOUR CODE ENDS HERE
}
else
{
  //YOUR CODE STARTS HERE



  //YOUR CODE ENDS HERE
}
return GrossSalary;</code></pre>
        </figure>
        <p>
          After updating the code, build the program again. This will check for
          errors in the code as well as run the tests again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Assuming that the code is correct for the if block, we see that only
          one of the two tests failed:

          The details include the name of the test file and the line number
          where the test starts, along with what the resulting output should be
          based on each test. This example includes a main test file
          (<code>EmployeeSalaryCalculatorTest</code>) and two separate tests:
          <code>testSalaryCalculator</code> and
          <code>testSalaryCalculator1</code>. The status at the top of the pane
          also reads "Tests failed: 2 of 2 tests."

          Review the instructions and find the file the instructions tell you to
          modify. In this example, we are using the
          <strong
            >EmployeeSalaryCalculator / src / main /
            EmployeeSalaryCalculator.java</strong
          >
          file.

        <p>
          Open the file in IntelliJ and find the code placeholders provided.
          Review the existing code to identify any variables or other code that
          already exists and that you will need to use in your solution, but
          remember that you should not change any existing code. All new code
          should be inside the placeholders provided.

          In this example, the assignment asks us to add code to the if-else
          block. We'll start with the if clause.
        </p>
        <p>Review the existing variables already declared in the class:</p>
        <figure>
          <pre
            class="prettyprint lang-java"
          ><code>final static int StandardWorkingHours = 40;
static String EmployeeID;
static String EmployeeName;
static int HoursWorked;
static int HourlyRate;
static int BasicPay;
static int OverTime;
static int OverTimeRate;
static int OverTimePay;
static int GrossSalary;</code></pre>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Because these variables already exist, we can use them in the methods
          without having to redeclare them.
        </p>
        <p>
          We want to calculate the total salary by multiplying the number of
          hours worked (HW) by the hourly rate (HR). We can write an equation
          for that. Note that the existing method
          (<code>SalaryCalculator</code>) returns the variable
          <code>GrossSalary</code>, so we want to be sure that the result is
          saved to <code>GrossSalary</code>.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <pre
            class="prettyprint lang-java"
          ><code>if(HW &lt;= StandardWorkingHours)
{
  //YOUR CODE STARTS HERE
  <mark>GrossSalary = HoursWorked * HourlyRate;</mark>

  //YOUR CODE ENDS HERE
}
else
{
  //YOUR CODE STARTS HERE



  //YOUR CODE ENDS HERE
}
return GrossSalary;</code></pre>

          After updating the code, build the program again. This will check for
          errors in the code as well as run the tests again. Assuming the code
          is correct, the test panel will now show that one test passed and one
          test failed.

          After verifying that the first test passes, use a similar approach to
          add code that passes the next test, using a different placeholder for
          new code.
